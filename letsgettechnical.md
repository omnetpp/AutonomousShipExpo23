# Let’s get technical!

The INET Framework is the most extensive network simulation framework for OMNEST. Here are some showcases that will enable you to get an in-depth understanding of some of its capabilities. The full documentation is also accessible from the link below.

There are also other frameworks that work in conjunction with INET, that you may find interesting:

### SimuLTE: [https://simulte.com/](https://simulte.com/)

SimuLTE is an innovative simulation tool enabling complex system level performance-evaluation of LTE and LTE Advanced networks (3GPP Release 8 and beyond) for the OMNeT++ framework. SimuLTE is written in C++ and is fully customizable with a simple pluggable interface. One can also develop new modules implementing new algorithms and protocols.

### Simu5G: [http://simu5g.org/](http://simu5g.org/)

The idea behind Simu5G is to let researchers simulate and benchmark their solutions on an easy-to-use framework. It borrows the concept of modularity from OMNeT++ thus it is easy to extend. Moreover, it can be integrated with other modules from the INET Framework. It supports optimization tools (e.g. optimization solvers such as CPLEX).

Simu5G is compatible with [SimuLTE](http://simulte.com/) and allows one to simulate network scenarios where 4G and 5G coexist, in both StandAlone (SA) and E-UTRA/NR Dual Connectivity (ENDC) deployments. Furthermore, it inherits SimuLTE's compatibility with other OMNeT++-based libraries, for instance, Veins for vehicular mobility.

### Veins: [https://veins.car2x.org/](https://veins.car2x.org/)

Veins is an open source Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) simulation framework composed of an event-based network simulator (OMNeT++) and a road traffic simulator (SUMO), using cosimulation.

### Artery: [https://github.com/riebl/artery](https://github.com/riebl/artery)

Artery enables V2X simulations based on ETSI ITS-G5 protocols like GeoNetworking and BTP. Single vehicles can be equipped with multiple ITS-G5 services through Artery’s middleware, which also provides common Facilities for these services. Artery started as an extension of the Veins framework but can be used independently nowadays.

### Plexe: [http://plexe.car2x.org/](http://plexe.car2x.org/)

Plexe is a cooperative driving framework extending [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) and [Veins](http://veins.car2x.org/) permitting the realistic simulation of platooning (i.e., automated car-following) systems. It features realistic vehicle dynamics and several cruise control models, permitting the analysis of control systems, large-scale and mixed scenario, as well as networking protocols and cooperative maneuvers. It is free to download and easy to extend.

### Lora: [https://flora.aalto.fi/](https://flora.aalto.fi/)

FLoRa allows the creation of LoRa networks with modules for LoRa nodes, gateway(s) and a network server. Application logic can be deployed as independent modules that are connected with the network server. The network server and nodes support dynamic management of configuration parameters through Adaptive Data Rate (ADR). Finally, the energy consumption statistics are collected in every node.
